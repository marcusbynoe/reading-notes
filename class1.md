# Class 1 Notes - Markdown

The main thing I've learned so far is how GitHub and Markdown works. Even though the material I've taken in so far is surface level things, I find the information very informative. It'll be a tall order to memorize everything, but I'm sure I'll be able to remember a good portion of codes through repetition (eventually). Learning how to comfortably *format* a page will allow me to allocate more time & resources into completing more detailed work.

**Bold** = ```** ** or __ __```

*Italics* = ```* * or _ _```

[This is a link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) = ```[Link Text](URL)```

***All bold and italic*** = ```*** ***```

Listed above is just some of the things I've learned when it comes to formatting.

## Things I want to know more about

Essentially I just want to know more about *"best practices"* when it comes to writing code. I also would like to know more if it is possible to add color to text and background, so it's just not a boring white background with generic black text.
