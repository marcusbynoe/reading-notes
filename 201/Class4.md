# Class 4 Notes

## Learn HTML

1. You use an `<a>` element to wrap the text or other content.

2. The `href` attribute contains the web address.

3. Including keywords in link text to describe what is being linked to helps search engines to index target files. Keeping link text short as possible helps out users using screen readers.

## CSS Layout

1. The way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout with CSS.

2. Block-level elements always start in a new line while inline elements do not force a new line to begin the document flow. Inline elements may contain only data and other inline elements.  

3. `Static positioning` is the default that every element gets. 

4. One advantage to using absolute positioning is that you can create isolated UI features that don’t interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. So popup info boxes and control menus could be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page.

5. The key difference between fixed and absolute positioning is that fixed positioning **usually** fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

## Learn JS

1. A function declaration defines a function with the specified parameters. With function invocation, code inside of a function is executed when the function is **invoked**.

2. `Parameters` are the names listed in the function’s definition. While arguments is a value passed as input to a function.

## Miscellaneous

1.Social Skills: Knowing myself, this would greatly benefit me as I am a fairly socially awkward individual in a lot of situations. Working on my interpersonal skills will not only help me grow as an individual, but also being a good coworker as well.

- Work Environment Readiness: This would help on my coding journey since being ready after being hired not only looks good for me. It also earns the trust of my employers knowing that I am a capable individual from the get go.

## Things I want to know more about
