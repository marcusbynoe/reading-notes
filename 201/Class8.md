# Class 8 Notes

## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. It excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.

2. The main axis is the one set by your `flex-direction property`. If that is `row` your main axis is along the row, if it is `column` your main axis is along the column. The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if `flex-direction` is `row` the cross axis runs along the column.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is responsive and mobile-friendly. Flexbox also makes vertically centering a block of content inside its parent easy to do. As well as making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

2. Being able to easily layout web pages with flexbox would be very beneficial in the future.
