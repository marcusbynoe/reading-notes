# Class 10 Notes

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. `Syntax Errors` are spellings errors within the that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through. While `logic errors` are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that the program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.

2. A good portion of my errors have been syntax related. Usually misspelling a word by one letter.

3. Attention to detail is the biggest thing. Being careless and sloppy when writing code will just add extra work. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast is the mantra to live by for sure.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. The debugger is like a window into your code which allows you to monitor and set breakpoints within it to identify problems that prevent the code from executing.

2. Breakpoints allow you to pause the execution in code. There are different types of breakpoints like `Line-of-code`, `Function`, `DOM`, etc. Knowing what type to use will save you time when debugging.

3. `Call Stack`: The  section that shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.

## Things I want to know more about

- Is the debugger always accurate in what is wrong with code?
