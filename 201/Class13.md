## Local Storage and How To Use It On Website

1. Even though HTTP is the main transport layer of the Web, it is stateless. Which means that when you use an application and then close it, its state will be reset the next time you open it. So as a developer, you need to store the state of the interface somewhere.

2. Sensitive information like passwords or personal information should not be stored in local storage.

3. Local Storage can only store string data. You would use the `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` methods.
