# Class 5 Notes

## HTML Media

1. A user who is using a screen reader would have the atl text read to them to describe the image.

2. Adding `<alt>` to provide a description to a picture in case someone is using a screen reader or if the image fails to load on the webpage. `<figcaption>` provides extra information to the image and supports the main text.

3. A `<figure>` can express a meaning in a compact and easy-to-grasp way.

4. A **gif** is a good choice for animations and simple images. A **svg** is good for displaying 2d graphics, charts and drawings.

5. A **PNG** image type. They are perfect for screenshots and other types of imagery where there's not a lot of color data.

## Learn CSS

1. Foreground color is the color of an HTML element’s content and the background color defines the element’s background color.

2. Would ask what type of theme/vibe they want their blog to be first. Then from there, create a template of what they wanted.

3. You have to consider using **web safe fonts** when picking one for you webpage. Using these fonts gives you the best chance of having your text appear as intended.

4. `font-style`: Used to turn italic text on or off.
  `font-weight`: Sets how bold the text is.
  `font-size`: Sets the size of the text.

5. One way you can create space is by using `padding` to generate space around the element. You can also use `margin-bottom` to create space between elements.
