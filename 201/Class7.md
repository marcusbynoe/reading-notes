# Class 7 Notes

## Domain Modeling

1. It creates a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. It can be used as a communication tool that defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

## HTML Table Basics

1. Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users. Screen reader’s output would be confusing to their users when read back to them . Tables produce tag soup. Tables require more complex code which may be difficult to write and maintain.

2. `<th>`: Defines a cell as header of a group of table cells.
  `<tr>`: Defines a row of cells in a table.
  `<td>`: Defines a standard data cell in an HTML table.

## Introducing Constructors

1. A constructor is just a function called using the `new` keyword. Calling a construction will: create a new object, bind `this` to the new object so you can refer to `this` in your constructor code, run the code in the constructor and return the new object.

2. In a constructor, `this` gets binded to the new object. Which allows you to refer to `this` in your constructor code. In object literal if you create more than one, `this`enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create.

## Object Prototypes Using a Constructor

1. So working for the TSA, I need to be able to see inside people’s bags to search. But I don’t have x-ray vision to be able to see inside them. So I decided that the X-ray machine should be my prototype. Since that relationship has been formed, I can now use all the cool stuff that the x-ray knows how to do. I can use an X-ray that will allow me to look inside people’s bags.
