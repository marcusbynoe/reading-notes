# Class 3 Notes

## Learn HTML

1. Unordered lists should be used for lists that have no numerical order or if their order has no meaning at all. 

2. You have to make changes in CSS to change the bullet style of an unordered list.

3. Ordered list should be used when the order of the items is important like a recipe or step-by-step instructions. Unordered lists should be used for things like a grocery list or a Christmas list.

4. For ordered lists if you want to change the numbering type you can do: `I` for uppercase Roman numerals and `A` for uppercase letters.

## Learn CSS

1. Padding is like a moat, ever expanding while protecting the contents inside. While the margin is like a black hole. Where if the values were negative, it overlaps and overtakes other things on the screen. (Sorry, I’m a terrible storyteller)

2. Content Box: This is where content is displayed

    Padding Box: Sits around the content as white space. As the name implies, it provides “padding” for the content inside.

3. Border Box: This box wraps around the content and padding. Size and style can be changed with `border`.

4. Margin Box: This is the last layer of the box. It is like a force-field as it pushes other elements away from the box. 

## Learn JS

1. You can store a variety of data types within an array. Some good examples are: `numbers`, `strings`, `boolean`, `objects` and many more!

2. TBD

4. `+=` can be used to concatenate strings

  - `x += f()`: Adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable.

  - `x -= f()`: Subtracts the value of the right operand from a variable and assigns the result to the variable. 

  - `x /= f()`: Divides a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable. 

  - `x *= f()`: multiplies a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable. 

4. The result of the expression is **10dog**

5. A good real world example of conditional statements is by entering passwords on a website. In order to login into your account, you need to input the correct password to continue. If the wrong password is put in, you have to try again.  

6. Loops are handy for repeating the same code over and over. Good example is a school website showing grades for students who check the page multiple times.
