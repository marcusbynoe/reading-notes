# Class 9 Notes

## HTML Forms

1. Forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a website or application. Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage, or used on the client-side to immediately update the interface in some way.

2. The size of the form should be kept in mind. Asking only for data that you absolutely need would keep the user experience short, simple and easy.

3. `<form>`: Formally defines a form. It’s an element made specifically for containing forms.

- `<label>`: Used to provide a usability improvement for mouse users.

- `<input>`: Used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user.

- `<textarea>`: Represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizable amount of free-form text.

- `<button>`: An interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs an action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.

## Learn JS - Intro To Events

1. Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react to them. For example, you are trying to walk across the street, but there are cars driving by. The green crosswalk signal communicates to you that it’s okay to walk across now. So now you are able to walk across.

2. You will need the name of the event we want to register this handler for, and the code that comprises the handler function we want to run in response to it.

3. The `event object` is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information. It is usually specified with a name such as `event`, `evt`, or `e`.

4. `Event bubbling` describes how the browser handles events targeted at nested elements. `Event capture` is the reverse of event bubbling. So instead of the event firing first on the innermost element targeted, and then on successively less nested elements, the event fires first on the least nested element, and then on successively more nested elements, until the target is reached.
