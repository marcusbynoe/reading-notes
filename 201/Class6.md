## Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

1. Objects are basically a collection of related data and/or functionality. It can be anything with variables and functions. 

2. Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually, and it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.

3. Arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable. While objects are a collection of data and/or functionality. Which usually consist of variables and functions. 

4. If an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation.

5. `This` refers to the current object the code is being written inside. 

## Introduction To The DOM

1. DOM is Document Object Model. Itâ€™s a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

2. Even though DOM is not a programming language things like table headers, the head, and text within table cells would be impossible to be accessed and modified with JavaScript. JavaScript and other program languages alike need DOM in order to interact with web pages, HTML documents, etc.
