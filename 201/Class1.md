# Class 1 Notes

## Getting Started

1. A client sends request
The server responds back
Resources needed to load a web page are sent back to the client.


2. Browsers request HTML files from servers. HTML files usually content <link> elements for CSS stylesheets and <script> elements which contain external JavaScript scripts. So when a browser parses these files the order goes: HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript

3. There are a variety of ways to find images to add to a website. You can simply use Google Images to find what is appropriate for your website. A good website for royalty free images is (link to unsplash.com). 

4. When it comes to a *string*, it is a sequence of text where you use single quote marks to signify that a value is a string. Whereas numbers do not have quotes around them.

- `String: let myCheese = ‘Havarti’;

- `Number: let myAge = 29;'

- Variables are containers that store values.in their websites/apps.

## Introduction to HTML

1. An HTML attribute contains extra information about an element that won’t appear in the content. 

2. The anatomy of a HTML document usually comprises between 5 to 6 elements. 

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` =  All HTML documents must start with this. The declaration informs browsers on what type of document to expect. 

- `<html></html>` = Wraps all the content on the page. 

- `<head></head>` = This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content the page will show to viewers.

- `<title></title>` = Sets the title of the page which also appears in the browser tab.

- `<body></body>` = Contains **all** the content that shows up on the page. 

3. A <section> tag defines a section in a document/page. While an <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content. 

4. A *typical* website usually includes: <header>, <nav>, <main>, <body>, <article>, <section>, and <footer>.

5. Metadata provides information to search engines about your website. It provides things such as a title or a description about your website. 

6. <meta> tags are typically used to specify a page description or character set for a HTML document. An example of this: `<meta name=”author” content=”Marcus Bynoe”>`

## How To Start To Design a Website

1. The first step to designing a website is establishing what the main purpose of your website is.

2. The most important question to answer is what exactly do you want to accomplish with your website.

## Semantics

1. <h1> tag is specifically used to define top level HTML heading. By default most browsers will style an <h1> with a large font. <span> is just an inline container. 

2. Some of the benefits of using semantics in HTML follows: Easier to find blocks of meaningful code and influences the page’s search rankings in search engines.

## What is JavaScript?

1. Web APIs require JavaScript in the browser to allow you to implement programs that would be very difficult to implement otherwise. HTML & CSS require JavaScript in order to create dynamic and highly interactive websites. 

2. If you want to add JavaScript to an HTML document, you can use the `<script></script>` tags with JavaScript code inserted between the tags.
