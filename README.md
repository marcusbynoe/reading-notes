# Reading Journal For Code Fellows 102
Reading notes journal for Code Fellows 102

*Hello my name is Marcus Bynoe! I am an Army veteran who is currently changing careers into the tech world. I always had a love/interest in technology and always wanted a career centered around it. Some of my hobbies include gaming :video_game:, hiking :national_park:, shooting (guns & bows)  	:bow_and_arrow:, traveling :airplane: and sports :football: :basketball: :soccer:.*

To me a growth mindset means you are always strving to be the best version of yourself. Always willing to learn and build your knowledge with an open mind. If you face challenges or failures; you are able to overcome and learn from them. 

**3 Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:**

- My first reminder to myself is to remember my goals. I want to explore and breakout into a new tech career so I can improve my quality of life. 
 
- Second reminder is that if I want to be the best version of myself, I **need** to have a growth mindset going into this. Having a fixed mindset will only make this program harder.  

- Everyone who is successful working in tech started from the bottom at one point in time. By staying in a growth mindset, I too can build myself up to where I can be successful in the career field.
