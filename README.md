Reading notes journal for Code Fellows 102

**Hello my name is Marcus Bynoe! I am an Army veteran who is currently changing careers into the tech world. I always had a love/interest in technology and always wanted a career centered around it. Some of my hobbies include gaming :video_game:, hiking :national_park:, shooting (guns & bows)  	:bow_and_arrow:, traveling :airplane: and sports :football: :basketball: :soccer:.**

To me a growth mindset means you are always strving to be the best version of yourself. Always willing to learn and build your knowledge with an open mind. If you face challenges or failures; you are able to overcome and learn from them. 

3 Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:

1. Reminder 1
2. Reminder 2
3. Reminder 3
