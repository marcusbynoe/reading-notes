## API Design Best Practices

1. Representational State Transfer (REST)

2. *Resources*

3. A URI that uniquely identifies that resource.

4. POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

5. Composed of keywords that are important to the content of the page.

6. The URI for a particular customer order: 1https://adventure-works.com/orders/1`

7. APIs that expose a large number of small resources. Having multiple requests leads to a bigger load.

8. `200 OK` status code

9. `404`: The requested resource was not found

10. `CREATED 201`

11. `202 ( Accepted )` status code
