# Engineering Readings

1. **What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?:** I believe that my work ethic is one of my greatest attributes when it comes to working. If i'm tasked with something, I take it upon myself to give my best effort.

2. **What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?:**

  - Take a break if I've been working on something for quite some time.

  - Going over notes and readings again to make sure I understand everything.

  - Simply ask for help.
