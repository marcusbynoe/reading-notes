Variables are containers for storing data. Example:
```console.log(a);`
`console.log(“Hello world!”);`

Variables can be declared 4 ways:
> Const → constant, can’t be changed`
> Let → changeable value
> Var → old way, don’t do this
> (none)

## Useful Functions
`console.log( )` → print information to the console
`alert( )` → give us a popup box
`prompt( )` → how you can get info from the user
`document.write( )` → how you will put content on your website
