# Class 6 Notes

## JavaScript

- JavaScript is a scripting language for the web which enables you to create dynamic content, control multimedia, create animation and many more things. It is possible to embed JavaScript code directly in the HTML file or include it externally from a JavaScript file.

## Details

 Embed JavaScript Code Into HTML: `<script>  </script>`

Variables are containers for storing data. Example:
`console.log(a);`
`console.log(“Hello world!”);`

Variables can be declared 4 ways:

`Const` → constant, can’t be changed`

`Let` → changeable value

`Var` → old way, don’t do this

## Useful Functions

`console.log( )` = print information to the console

`alert( )` = give us a popup box

`prompt( )` = how you can get info from the user

`document.write( )` = how you will put content on your website

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to know more advanced functions that an end user could interact with to make the webpage mroe fun.
