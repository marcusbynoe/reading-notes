## What is CSS?

CSS is "Cascading Style Sheets", which is a rule-based language that modifies pages to be more appealing to the viewer. With just HTML alone, browsers would show webpages at their default setting which is a white background and plain black text. With CSS, you can control how HTML elements look in the browser and show your unique design. CSS specifies how documents are presented in a browser.

## How To Add CSS

There are three ways of applying CSS:

- External CSS: this method allows you to design an entire website by editing one file

- Internal CSS: Internal CSS can be utilized if only one HTML page needs to be designed. They're defined within a <style> element.

- Inline CSS: Inline CSS is not recommended by most as the style is mixed within HTML elements. This can make your code more liable to errors if done incorrectly.
