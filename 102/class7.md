## Control Flow

Control flow is the order in which a computer runs statements. Typically code is run in order from the first line to the last line. Control flow can be changed with conditionals, loops and functions. Besides reading a script from start to end, you must also view program structure and order of execution.

## JavaScript Functions

Blocks of code designed to perform a certain task is a *JavaScript function*.

## Some Examples

JavaScript Function Syntax: Defined with the `function` keyword, followed by a **name**, followed by parentheses `( )`.

Function Invocation: Code will execute when “something” invokes the function.
