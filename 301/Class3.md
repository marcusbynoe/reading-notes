## The Spread Operator

1. **What is the spread operator?:** It takes in an iterable (e.g an array) and expands it into individual elements.

2. **List 4 things that the spread operator can do.:** Copying an array, Concatenating or combining arrays, Using Math functions, Adding to state in React.

3. **Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.:**  

```
const marvel = ['Iron Man', 'Captain America'];
const dc = ['Batman', 'Superman'];

const all = [...marvel, ...dc];

all; // ['Iron Man', 'Captain America', 'Batman', 'Superman'];
```

4. **Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.:**

```
const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]
```

5. **Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.:**

```
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
```
