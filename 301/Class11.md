### nosql vs sql

1. **Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

  - SQL:  -Replication: By replicating MySQL database across multiple nodes the work load can be reduced heavily increasing the scalability and availability of business application

  - Cost effectiveness: It is open source and free.
  
  - Wide range of Platforms and Languages: MySql is available for all major platforms like Linux, Windows, Mac, BSD and Solaris. It also has connectors to languages like Node.js, Ruby, C#, C++, C, Java, Perl, PHP and Python.

  - Maturity: This database has been around for a long time and tremendous community input and testing has gone into this database making it very stable.

  - Memcached as a NoSQL API to MySQL: Memcached can be used to increase the performance of the data retrieval operations giving an advantage of NoSQL api to MySQL server.

  -NoSQL: MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis

  - Speed: For simple queries, it gives good performance, as all the related data are in single document which eliminates the join operations.

  - Scalability: It is horizontally scalable i.e. you can reduce the workload by increasing the number of servers in your resource pool instead of relying on a stand alone resource.

  - Schema-less: As a member of NoSQL family, it also have dynamic schema which makes it more flexible, having a form of JSON documents for storing data.

  - Conflict Resolution: It has automatic conflict detection which is useful while in a distributed database.

  - Redis as Cache: You can use Redis as a cache by implementing keys with limited time to live to improve the performance.

2. **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?:** Structured Data

3. **Give a real world example.:** Numerical type data such as Date and Time.

4. **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?:** NoSQL databases are often better suited to storing and modeling structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in one database.

5. **Give a real world example.:** College database filled with student information.

6. **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?:** NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage. Like Hbase.

7. **Which type of database is best for scalability?:** Honestly both are good for scalability. MongoDB is good for scalability.

## SQL vs NOSQL

1. **What does SQL stand for?:**Structured Query Language

2. **What is a relational database?:**A type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. 

3. **What type of structure does a relational database work with?:**A relational database (RDB)

4. **What is a ‘schema’?:**It's just a declarative format for describing the structure of other data.

5. **What is a NoSQL database?:**Non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables.

6. **How does it work?:**

7. **What is inside of a MongoDB database?:**A database contains the collections of documents.

8. **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.:**MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability.

9. **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?:**One of the most frequently cited drawbacks of NoSQL databases is that they don't support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions across multiple documents.
